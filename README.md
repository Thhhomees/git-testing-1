## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Test and practice Git workflows such as:
  - Pull requests
  - Branching strategies
  - Rebases
  - Merges
  - Cherry-picking
  - Conflict resolution
- Experiment with advanced Git operations.
- Simulate real-world Git scenarios to better understand their behavior.
- Serve as a collaborative space to refine Git skills.

## Usage
Feel free to use this repository for any of the following:

1. Pull Request Testing
Create branches, make changes, and submit pull requests to:
  - Test pull request workflows.
  - Simulate review processes.
  - Practice resolving merge conflicts.

2. Branching and Merging
Experiment with creating, merging, and deleting branches to:
  - Understand branching strategies.
  - Practice fast-forward vs. non-fast-forward merges.
  - Simulate real-world team collaboration.

3. Rebasing and Cherry-Picking
Use this repository to:
  - Rebase branches onto others to test and learn about history rewriting.
  - Cherry-pick commits to extract specific changes from one branch to another.

4. Conflict Resolution
Introduce intentional conflicts to:
  - Practice resolving merge and rebase conflicts.
  - Gain confidence in handling tricky situations in Git.

5. Custom Scenarios

  - Amendments to commits.
  - Stash usage and recovery.
  - Undoing changes (e.g., git reset, git revert).


## Best Practices
- Keep it clean: After testing, consider cleaning up your branches or experiments to keep the repository organized.
- Work collaboratively: If you're testing workflows with others, communicate your goals clearly.
- Experiment freely: This repository is for learning and experimentation—don't be afraid to make mistakes!


## Contributing
